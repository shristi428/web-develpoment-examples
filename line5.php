  <h1> Giant Dog Breeds</h1>
  <p class="ridge"> A giant dog breed has no universal height or weight classification, although some groups define "giant breeds" as those heavier than 50 kilograms.</br> Giant breeds grow rapidly, but take longer to mature into their full adult sizes than smaller dogs.Many giant breeds are mature, soft and relaxed dogs as adults and require less exercise than most smaller dogs, so they can make better pets for small living arrangements, such as apartments.</br> Because they are larger animals, they are less likely to be intimidated by other people and thus are much more adaptable to meeting friends, family members, and children of owners.</br> They are normally very calm and are great family dogs. If they sense a threat towards their owner, they will become very protective. They are, in general, stronger than other breeds and many giant breeds are well known for their working abilities</p>

 <h2><b><u> Great Dane</u></b><h2>
 <p> The Great Dane is a breed of German origin and its German name of Deutsche Dogge, means German mastiff. </br>However, before setting down official roots in Germany, the dogs that eventually became the Great Dane breed came from a crossbreed between English mastiffs and Irish wolfhounds.</br>
Though they aren't the heaviest dogs, reaching around 100-120 pounds, they are among the tallest. The average Great Dane stands around 28-30 inches tall but often they can be taller.</br> The world record holder for tallest dog was a Great Dane named Zeus who stood an astounding 44 inches tall.</br> However, these big dogs trade longevity for their size, and live only to be between 6 to 8 years old. Zeus died of old age at just 5 years old.</p></div>

 <h2><b><u> Neapolitan mastiff</u></b><h2>
 <p> Mastiff breeds are certainly among the largest dogs in terms of sheer mass. The Neapolitan mastiff originated in southern Italy.</br> Used as a guard dog, the average male mastiff stands between 26-31 inches tall and weighs a hefty 130-155 pounds. Females are usually a little smaller, standing a few inches shorter and weighing 110-130 pounds.</br>
This breed is known for being fearless and protective of home and family, making it an ideal guard dog — but not an ideal warning system.</br> Mastiffs tend to be quiet, and are known for sneaking up on intruders rather than barking to warn them off.</br> Because of the breed's protective nature, you certainly don't want to stand between these dogs and their family, which makes this dog a breed only for owners well versed in dog training and able to put in the extensive time needed for socialization.</p></div>

 <h2><b><u>  Scottish Deerhound</u></b><h2>
 <p> Going back to the leggy breeds, the Scottish deerhound gives away its purpose and origin in its name.</br> Originating in Scotland well before recorded history, the breed is a courser, once used to hunt red deer and easily chasing down its prey. They are larger and heavier than greyhounds but are built similarly, with a lanky body meant for speed.</br>
Deerhounds can stand as tall as 32 inches and weigh as much as 110 pounds.</br> Though they aren't used for deer hunting today, the breed is kept alive by enthusiasts who use them for show and in some places, lure coursing.</p></div>

 <h2><b><u> Newfoundland </u></b><h2>
 <p>  The Newfoundland is a working dog from, you guessed it, Newfoundland. Unlike many larger breeds, the Newfie wasn't bred to be a guard dog.</br> Instead, its purpose was originally to help fishermen. The big, muscular dogs are able to haul nets and lines from boats, pull carts and, most importantly, fetch anything that falls overboard, including people.</br> The breed is an exceptional water dog and strong swimmer, and there have been many rescues of people out at sea credited to these big, gentle-natured dogs.</br>
Newfoundland dogs stand between 27-30 inches tall and weigh as much as 150 pounds. </br>They look even bigger because of their thick double coat, which keeps them warm even in icy water.</p></div>

 <h2><b><u>Saint Bernard</u></b><h2>
 <p> The Saint Bernard of brandy-toting fame is a breed originally created in the Swiss Alps and northern Italy as a rescue dog.</br> The monks of the Saint Bernard Hospice are credited with training dogs for rescue and for playing a role in developing the breed we know today. Dogs can stand between 25-30 inches tall and weigh anywhere from 140 to 180 pounds.</br>Though they were originally used as rescue dogs to find and save travelers, today's Saint Bernards are mostly family dogs.</br> They are famous for being gentle, loving, friendly and great with children. They are also apparently great with kittens, too:</p></div>
